1. In high level language, what 3 things does function declaration require 
- name of function
- what function returns (type)
- paramters of function

-2 points
2. in assembly language 3 parts
- prologue
- code function
- epilogue

2b. -1 point
- prologue - sets up registers, sets up pointers, allocate memory on the 
stack/heap for variables
- code - tells us step by step instructions on how to carry out the 
function to obtain our answer/desired result
- epilogue - answer in register rax, cleans up pointers, cleanas up memory

 
3. two things cannot do without OS support
- access files
- access keyboard

4. write system calls to ask the operating system to do those things. in 
order to do this sys call, you need to change the register values to the 
ones outlined by the table in lecture (ex: 1 in rax is the syscall for 
write)

5. when you run a syscall, you change levels into the kernel level. then 
the operating system has a pointer that it must shift to whatever call you 
were trying to make (ex 1 for write), then the operating system executes 
those lines of code that the syscall outlines. then the operating system 
puts the return values into the correct registers, resets its pointer so 
it can continue normal processing later and then goes back up to the outer 
layers of privilege to go back to the user part.
