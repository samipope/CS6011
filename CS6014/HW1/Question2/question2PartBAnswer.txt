Question 2 part B

Part B (3 points): Suppose one of the three traceroute delay values between the source and a given router hop turns out to be unusually high. What are two possible causes for this unusually high delay?


One reason for this unusually high delay could because of queuing delay. This depends on the traffic in the router at any given time. This could be particularly high at one moment, where the router queue stacks up.

Another reason for this being unusually high could be due to propagation delay. This is the time it takes for a signal to travel from one point to another. There could be multiple spots where the physical distance to travel would be significantly higher than others.
