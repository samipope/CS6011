Which two binarySearch tests are failing?
the second and the third ones are failing in the debuggerpractice file. 
Here are the lines:
 if(Part1.binarySearch(arr1, 0) == true) System.out.println("Binary search is broken");
     if(Part1.binarySearch(arr2, 20) == false) System.out.println("Binary search is broken");

What are the values of arr and goal passed in to binary search?
arr: [1,2,3,4,5] goal:0 (in the second case where it is failing)


For each of the two cases of binarySearch that are failing, which return statements are they executing in error (is it returning true when it should be returning false, or the other way around)?
The seoncd line is returning false when it should be returning true (according to the debuggertest document).
The third line is returning false when it should be returning true when it should be returning false (according to the debuggertest document).

What is the bug in binarySearch? How do you fix it?
The bug was that it wasn't looking at arr[mid], but mid itself. I fixed the bug by changing lines 9 and 11 in the function from the variable "mid" to "arr[mid]".


Which loops appear to be inifinite?
loop 2 and loop 4 appear to be infinite. 


For the loops that you found to be infinite, briefly explain why they are never progressing.
In loop 2, b is set to 0 to start. then it is multiplied by different variable(a). the loop happens when b is less than 10. no operations are being performed on b that make it stop running.
In loop four, it will stop when f is below 0. the iterations of the loop make the value of f go between 5 and 6. 


What does the call to password.split(" ") appear to do? Hint: examine the input value of "password", then examine the items in the "tokens" array returned by the call.
the tokens array has 3 values. it creates a new token inbetween each space in the string. "a" is a token, "b" is a token, and "c" is a token


What is the correct password?
"1 4 9 16 25"
