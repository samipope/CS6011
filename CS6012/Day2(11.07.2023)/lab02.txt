1. On your computer, how many times per second does the millisecond timer update?
The millisecond timer updated 1000.4 times per second when I made it 10 seconds long to run. The loop tested the time 359933584 times when I ran it for 10 seconds. 


2. Is it possible to determine how many times per second the nanosecond timer updates? If so, how many? If not, why not?



3. Judging by experiment 4, how long does it appear to take to compute System.nanoTime()?



4. Estimate the precision of your answer above (+/- how many nanoseconds?)



5. How long does it take to compute the square root of the numbers 1 through 10?



6. Estimate the precision of your answer above (+/- how many nanoseconds?)



7. If you repeat the square root test 100x as many times, does the precision improve?



8. How could you improve the results (get a more accurate estimate of elapsed time)?
