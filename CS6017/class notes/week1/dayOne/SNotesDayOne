# 017: data analysis and visualization
# How to make sense of data and communicate it

# Have to use a different version of python each project
# python intelliJ??

# Python:
# 	Indents to have blocks, no curly braces
# 	Dynamically typed

# for x in range(10)
# 	print(x)

# Before you submit â†’ do runAll to make sure it works

# Display is better than print for complex types

# 1. Tuples --> like a struct data type
#  immutable which means you CANNOT change it. it is different than lists
#  with a tuple, you can go into the array it is storing and change the values in that array as long as the array you are pointing do doesn't change

# Aside: Functions with Multiple return values
#     you are retuning a tuple, but looks like you are returning a lot of stuff

# def multiply(a, b, c):
#     return (a*b), (a*c), (b*c), (a*b*c)
